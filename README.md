<p>
As far as the datasets is concerned, for the purpose of the experiment described in the above mentioned paper, we generated the following 5 sets, each one corresponding to an experiment run. Each set contains one pair of files.
</p>

Each delicious_train_X.csv file contains the bogus data generated for the particular experiment run (where X is a number denoting the experiment run, and it ranges from 1 to 5). In the same way, every delicious_small_X.csv file contains the selected legitimate data used for the same experiment run.
The number of records in every delicious_train_X.csv file is the 30% of the number of records of the adjucent delicous_small_X.csv file. That is because we chose to train the classifiers with 30% bogus data, over the original legitimate data.

<p>
The content in the data files has the following structure:
<b>
product_ID &lt space &gt username &lt space &gt tag_1,tag_2,..., tag_n
</b>
</p>

The code will published soon.
