As far as the datasets we generated for the purpose of the experiment described in the above mentioned paper, we provide in total 5 sets, one for each run of the experiment. Each set contains one pair of files.

Each delicious_train_X.csv file contains the bogus data generated for the particular experiment run (where X a number defining the experiment, and it ranges from 1 to 5). In the same way, every delicious_small_X.csv file contains the selected legitimate data used for the same experiment run.

The code will published soon.
