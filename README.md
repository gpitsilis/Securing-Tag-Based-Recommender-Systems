As far as the datasets we generated with the bogus data for the purpose of the experiment described in the published paper, we provide in total 5 sets, one for each run of the experiment. Each set contains one pair of files.

Every delicious_train_X.csv file contains the bogus data generated for the particuler experiment run, while every delicious_small_X.csv file contains the selected legitimate data used for the same experiment run.
