Code and Data associated with RecSys'18 paper

As far as the datasets we generated with the bogus data for the purpose of the experiment described in the published paper, we provide in total 5 sets, one for each run of the experiment. Each set contains one pair of files.

Every delicious_train_X.csv file contains the bogus data generated for the particuler experiment run, while every delicious_small_X.csv file contains the selected legitimate data used for the same experiment run.
